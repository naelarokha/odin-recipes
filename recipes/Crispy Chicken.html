        <p>The secret is actually very simple. In this article, We will reveal the secret to making crispy fried chicken at home in 5 easy steps. Let's learn how.</p>
        <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate First</li>
                <p>This marinade doesn't require complicated seasonings.You can use a mixture of salt and pepper.
                    <br><br>To ensure the seasonings are fully absorbed, allow 30 minutes to 1 hour for this marinade. If you want it crispier, you can store it in the freezer for 12-24 hours.
                    <br><br>Next, while the chicken is marinating, you can prepare the flour for frying.
                </p>
            <li>Soak in Wet Flour Batter</li>
                <p>The second secret: you need to prepare two types of batter: a wet batter and a dry batter. The wet batter will stick to the chicken's skin and meat, while the dry batter will give it a crispy texture.
                    <br><br>If you prefer, you can also peel the skin off the chicken, leaving only the meat. For the wet batter, use the following recipe:
                    <br><br>Mix flour and cornstarch in an 80:20 ratio. For a crispier batter, use ice water instead of eggs.
                    <br><br>Dip the chicken in the wet batter until it's completely submerged.
                    <br><br>It doesn't take long to soak the chicken in the flour. The important thing is that the batter and chicken are thoroughly mixed.
                </p>
            <li>Coat with Dry Flour Batter</li>
                <p>After soaking in the wet flour batter, immediately coat with the dry flour batter. For the dry flour batter, prepare wheat flour, tapioca flour, and rice flour. Mix all ingredients in a 4:1:1 ratio.
                    <br><br>For a more crispy crust, add baking soda to taste. Also, prepare a pinch of salt, pepper, garlic, and coriander powder. Add all ingredients and stir thoroughly for a more intense flavor. Be careful, Mom, don't mix up the salt with the granulated sugar, as it won't have a strange taste.
                    <br><br>Next, don't forget to pinch the skin and batter. This is the secret to making curly and crispy fried chicken. The pinched portion will puff up and become crispy after frying.
                    <br><br>Do this one by one by placing the chicken on the flour, then dusting it with flour until it's completely coated. Then, remove the chicken and tap it lightly to remove any loose flour.
                </p>
            <li>Dip 2-3 Times</li>
                <p>To achieve a crispy and thick exterior, repeat steps 2 and 3 2 or 3 times. In other words, dip the chicken in the wet batter, then coat it in the dry batter. Then, dip it in the wet batter again, and then coat it in the dry batter again.
                    <br><br>Make sure the coating is thick enough to create a curly, crispy fried chicken. However, don't overcook it, as it won't become tough. Don't forget to pinch the skin and batter together.
                </p>
            <li>Deep Frying</li>
                <p>Deep frying is a method of frying with a lot of oil so that the entire chicken is submerged in the oil. This eliminates the need to flip the chicken frequently. This method not only ensures even cooking, but also minimizes the crumbly coating, which can quickly stain the cooking oil.
                    <br><br>To begin, adjust the oil temperature so that it's not too hot so the meat can cook through. Once it's golden brown, increase the temperature until the outside of the fried chicken is brown.
                    <br><br>This means the crispy fried chicken is done; simply remove it and let it drain until the oil is completely gone. That's how to make crispy chicken that's crispy and crunchy for up to 8 hours. Give it a try, Mom; we guarantee your whole family will love it and won't want to buy fried chicken from outside again.
